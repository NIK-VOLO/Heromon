NIKITA VOLODIN: HEROMON PROJECT
===============================

Controlling the game is pretty simple. 

To begin, you are prompted to create a character by typing a character name and choosing a class. 
Throughout the game you will be given options for actions that you may take. 
Every action can be chosen by inputing the correspoding number that will appear on the screen. 

You are given an inventory of items that can be used to help you fight the monster. 
Use them well and you can swing the fight heavily in your favor.
